In the context of Internet Relay Chat (IRC), "relay" in the name stands for the act of relaying or forwarding messages between users. 
In IRC, messages are sent to a server, which then relays the message to other users in the same channel or to specific users in private messages. The server acts as a relay, forwarding messages between users who are connected to it.

In general, the term "relay" refers to the act of passing information from one point to another. It is commonly used in the context of networking and communication protocols, where devices or systems pass data packets or messages between each other, allowing information to be transmitted over a network or between different systems.
